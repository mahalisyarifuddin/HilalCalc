# 1400-1900 AH Ground Truth & Linear Formula

## Generation Criteria
The Ground Truth (GT) data for Hijri months starting from 1400 AH to 1900 AH was generated using the following composite criteria:
- **Mecca**: Altitude >= 3°, Elongation >= 6.4° (at sunset on the 29th day).
- **Kuala Belait (KB)**: Altitude >= 0° (at sunset on the 29th day).
- **Condition**: Both sets of criteria must be met for the new month to begin the next day. Otherwise, the month has 30 days.
- **Base Date**: Muharram 1400 AH corresponds to JD 2444199 (Tuesday, Nov 20, 1979).

## Linear Formula Approximation
To approximate the Hijri calendar using a linear formula with constants limited to one decimal place, the following formula was derived to maximize accuracy against the GT:

```
JD = floor((18161.3 * Index + 1503182641.2) / 615)
```

Where:
- `Index = (Year - 1400) * 12 + (Month - 1)`
- `Month` is 1-based (1=Muharram, ..., 12=Dhu al-Hijjah).

## Accuracy
- **Total Months**: 6001 (1400 AH to 1900 AH).
- **Exact Matches**: 4369 (72.80%).
- **Mismatch**: The linear formula may differ by +/- 1 day due to the irregular nature of lunar visibility and the composite criteria.
